## Installation instructions
Requires **Unity 2019.2** or later. Tested on Windows, WebGL, Android and iOS.

There are several ways to install Procedural Toolkit:

### Install via OpenUPM
The package is available on the [openupm registry](https://openupm.com). It's recommended to install it via [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli).

```
openupm add com.syomus.proceduraltoolkit
```

### Install via Git URL
The alternative way is to install this library as a [Git package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html) using the Package Manager.
First, make sure that you to have Git installed and available in your system's PATH.
After that you need to add the following line to your project's `manifest.json`:
```
"com.syomus.proceduraltoolkit": "https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit.git",
```

It should look like this, notice the comma at the end of the line:
```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.syomus.proceduraltoolkit": "https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit.git",
    "com.unity.package-manager-ui": "1.0.0",
    "com.unity.modules.ai": "1.0.0",
    "com.unity.modules.animation": "1.0.0",
    ...
  }
}
```

If you don't want to use Git, you can download this library as an archive and install it as a [local package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html).

### Asset Store or .unitypackage
The other way is to import a package from the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/procedural-toolkit-16508) 
or the [Releases page](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/releases).
If you have any previous versions of the toolkit installed, it is highly recommended to delete them before importing a newer version.

### Getting started
After installation you can import `ProceduralToolkit` namespace and start building your own PCG systems:
```C#
using UnityEngine;
using ProceduralToolkit;

public class ReadmeExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Update()
    {
        Debug.Log(string.Format("<color=#{0}>{0}</color>", RandomE.colorHSV.ToHtmlStringRGB()));
    }
}
```

If you are using [Assembly Definitions](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html), 
you will also need to add `ProceduralToolkit` as a reference.
